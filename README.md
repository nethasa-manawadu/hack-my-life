#  hack-my-life

> Welcome to the forbidden folder. You weren’t supposed to find this… but here you are. 🤌🐦‍⬛

**WARNING:** This is not your grandma’s portfolio. 😒
This is a fully operational hacking terminal-themed portfolio. If you came here for a clean white background and pastel buttons... you’ve been compromised, agent.

## About Me

I'm Dunithi Nethasa Manawadu, but you can call me `Nethasa` (I don't like my first name 😔).  
"Sometimes I wanna hang my head...
but my brain whispers,
‘You got enemies to flex on. Get up. 😉’

Yeah, I’m fighting long-term depression like it’s the final boss,
and my hairline already rage-quit the game.

Still coding. Still surviving. Still stylish (in terminal green). ⚡

Welcome to my dark-humor-coded portfolio — because therapy is expensive, but open-source is free.
